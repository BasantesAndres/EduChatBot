Initially, you process the words (shallow processing).  Later, you might analyze the sentence’s meaning and implications (deep processing).\n\n3.  **Attention & Perception** (Weeks 5-6)\n    *   **Intuition:**  We are constantly bombarded with sensory information. This section examines how we select and interpret that information.\n    *   **Key Definitions:**\n        *   *Selective Attention:* The ability to focus on one stimulus while ignoring others.\n        *   *Gestalt Principles:* Rules describing how we organize visual information.\n    *   **Example:**  Trying to listen to a conversation in a noisy coffee shop – you’re selectively attending to the speaker’s voice.\n\n4.  **Memory** (Weeks 7-9)\n    *   **Intuition:** This explores the different systems involved in storing and retrieving information.\n    *   **Key Definitions:**\n        *   *Sensory Memory:* Brief storage of sensory information.\n        *   *Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory:* Temporary storage and manipulation of information.\n        *   *Long-Term Memory (LTM):* Relatively permanent storage of information.\n    *   **Example:**  Remembering a phone number you just heard – that’s an example of short-term memory.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** According to the course syllabus (available on Canvas), we will also be dedicating time to discuss cognitive biases and the role of embodiment in cognition.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these topics in more detail, or perhaps discuss the syllabus in greater depth?", "final_answer": "Okay, let’s break down the topics covered in UC1 (Introduction to Cognitive Science) according to the course syllabus.\n\n**UC1: Introduction to Cognitive Science – Course Topics**\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the major topics, with some detail for each:\n\n1.  **What is Cognitive Science?** (Weeks 1-2)\n    *   **Intuition:** This section introduces the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science – it’s about understanding how the mind works, drawing on insights from psychology, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, and philosophy.\n    *   **Key Definitions:**\n        *   *Cognition:* The mental processes involved in acquiring knowledge and understanding.\n        *   *Cognitive Science:* The study of the mind, encompassing its processes and structures.\n        *   *Cognitive Architectures:* Frameworks for understanding the overall organization of the mind.\n    *   **Example:**  Consider how a smartphone’s interface is designed – it’s informed by cognitive science principles about how people perceive information, make decisions, and remember things.\n\n2.  **Information Processing Models** (Weeks 3-4)\n    *   **Intuition:** This explores how we can think about the mind as a computer, processing information in stages.\n    *   **Key Definitions:**\n        *   *Serial Processing:* Information is processed one step at a time.\n        *   *Parallel Processing:* Multiple processes occur simultaneously.\n        *   *Levels of Processing:*  Depth of information processing (shallow vs. deep).\n    *   **Example:**  Reading a sentence.

DATABASES AND DBMS – DEFINITIONS\n==================================================\n\nA database system (DBS) is a computerized record-keeping system whose purpose is to \nstore related data and make information available when required.\n\nA Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of software programs that allow the \ncreation, management, and controlled access to a database.\n\nExamples of popular DBMS: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB (NoSQL), etc.\n\n--------------------------------\n1.1 Objectives of Database Systems\n--------------------------------\n\nTypical objectives of a DBS include:\n\n- Security & Protection:\n  Prevent unauthorized access and protect data from concurrent interference.\n\n- Reliability:\n  Provide stable, predictable performance and safe storage.\n\n- Multi-user Support:\n  Allow multiple users and applications to work with the same data.\n\n- Flexibility:\n  Support different logical views and multiple ways of accessing data.\n\n- Ease of Data Access and Modification:\n  Provide high-level query languages (e.g., SQL).\n\n- Accuracy & Consistency:\n  Enforce integrity rules so data remains correct.\n\n- Clarity & Standardization:\n  Avoid ambiguity by using standardized formats and definitions.\n\n- Ability to Handle Unanticipated Requests:\n  Allow ad-hoc queries and reporting.\n\n- Protection of Investment:\n  Support backup and recovery.\n\n- Minimization of Data Proliferation:\n  Encourage reuse of existing data instead of creating redundant files.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n1.2 Data Independence\n--------------------------------\n\nData independence is the immunity of application programs to changes in data structure \nor access strategy.\n\n- Physical Data Independence:\n  Applications are independent of file organization, hardware, or storage medium.\n\n- Logical Data Independence:\n  Each user or application can have its own logical view of the data without \n  needing a global view.\n\nData independence is important because:\n- Different applications need different views of the same data.\n- Performance tuning and structural changes should not break existing programs.\n\n==================================================\n2. DBMS ARCHITECTURE (THREE LEVELS)\n==================================================\n\nA classic DBMS architecture includes three levels: external, conceptual, and internal.\n\n--------------------------------\n2.1 External Level (User Views)\n--------------------------------\n\n- Represents the individual views of different users or applications.\n- Defined by external schemas.\n- Each external schema shows only the portion of the database relevant to that user.\n- Applications access the database through these external schemas using host languages\n  (e.g., C, Java, Python) combined with the data sublanguage (SQL).\n\n--------------------------------\n2.2 Conceptual Level (Logical Schema)\n--------------------------------\n\n- An abstract representation of the entire database content.\n- Defined by the conceptual or logical schema.\n- Specifies:\n  * Entities and relationships\n  * Attributes and domains\n  * Security constraints, integrity checks, and business rules\n\n- Must be:\n  * Comprehensive (covers the whole database)\n  * Independent from physical storage details\n  * Compatible with data independence\n\n--------------------------------\n2.3 Internal Level (Storage View)\n--------------------------------\n\n- Low-level representation of the database.\n- Defined by the internal schema.\n- Deals with:\n  * Record formats and field representation\n  * Indexes\n  * File organization and storage sequence\n  * Access paths\n\nThis level has strong impact on performance (I/O, indexing, caching, etc.).\n\n==================================================\n3. DBMS COMPONENTS\n==================================================\n\nFunctional components of a DBMS include:\n\n- DBMS Engine:\n  Links subsystems to the physical device through the operating system. \n  Manages file access and data transfer.\n\n- Data Definition Subsystem:\n  Tools for defining and altering the schema (DDL).\n\n- User Interface Subsystem:\n  Allows users and applications to query the database using SQL or other interfaces.\n\n- Application Development Subsystem:\n  Tools for building forms, reports, menus, and application logic.\n\n- Data Administration Subsystem:\n  Utilities for backup, recovery, tuning, and storage management. Used by DBAs.\n\n- Data Dictionary / System Catalog:\n  Stores metadata about tables, columns, relationships, constraints, users, and privileges.\n\n- Data Communications Manager:\n  Manages communication between clients and the DBMS in client–server environments.\n\n- Utilities:\n  Programs for loading data, exporting/importing, gathering statistics, etc.\n\n==================================================\n4. FRONT-END VS BACK-END\n==================================================\n\n- Front-End:\n  End users, applications, and programming interfaces (IDEs such as Visual Studio, NetBeans, Qt).\n  Typically handles forms, reports, and business logic.\n\n- Back-End:\n  The DBMS and the database itself.\n  Responsible for storage, query processing, transaction management, concurrency, and recovery.\n\nFront-end and back-end may run on different machines connected via a network.\n\n==================================================\n5. DBMS VS FILE PROCESSING SYSTEMS\n==================================================\n\nTraditional file systems store data in separate files for each application.\n\nProblems with file processing:\n\n- Redundancy and Inconsistency:\n  Duplicate data across files leads to contradictory values.\n\n- Difficult Access:\n  New reports require new programs.\n\n- Data Isolation:\n  Data scattered in multiple files with different formats.\n\n- Lack of Integrity:\n  Hard to enforce rules (e.g., valid department numbers, account balances).\n\n- Atomicity Problems:\n  Multi-step operations (e.g., bank transfers) may fail in the middle.\n\n- Concurrency Problems:\n  Simultaneous updates may lead to lost updates or inconsistent data.\n\n- Security Problems:\n  Difficult to control user access to specific subsets of data.\n\nThe database approach, using a DBMS, provides integration and sharing of data, \nbetter integrity, and centralized control.\n\n==================================================\n6. DATABASE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (DDLC)\n==================================================\n\nPhases and typical deliverables:\n\n1) Database Investigation and Analysis\n   - Goal: understand business requirements.\n   - Deliverable: Initial Database Requirements.\n\n2) Database Modeling\n   - Build conceptual models (ERDs) and process models.\n   - Deliverable: Database Model.\n\n3) Database Designing\n   - Design the logical schema and constraints.\n   - Deliverable: Database Design Specification.\n\n4) Database Development\n   - Implement the logical design in a DBMS.\n   - Deliverable: Actual Database.\n\n5) Implementation\n   - Deploy database in production and integrate with applications.\n   - Deliverable: Database in Use.\n\n6) Management\n   - Monitor, tune, backup, and evolve the database.\n   - Deliverable: Enhanced Database and updated documentation.\n\nThe process is iterative: if requirements are incorrect or incomplete,\ndesign and analysis must be revisited.\n\n==================================================\n7. RELATIONAL MODEL FOUNDATIONS\n==================================================\n\nThe relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd (1970) and uses mathematical \nrelations (tables) to represent data.\n\nKey concepts:\n\n- Relation → Table.\n- Tuple → Row (record).\n- Attribute → Column (field).\n- Domain → Set of allowed values for an attribute.\n\nTables represent entity types; rows represent individual entities.\n\nRelationships between tables are represented using primary keys and foreign keys.\n\n--------------------------------\n7.1 Tables and Relationships\n--------------------------------\n\n- A table stores data in rows and columns.\n  Example: Books(BookID, Title, Author, Year).\n\n- A relationship connects tables via common attributes.\n  Common types:\n  * One-to-one (1:1)\n  * One-to-many (1:N)\n  * Many-to-many (M:N)\n\n- Referential Integrity:\n  Foreign keys in one table must match existing primary keys in another.\n  Prevents orphan records and ensures consistency.\n\n==================================================\n8. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ER MODEL\n==================================================\n\nConceptual design transforms user requirements into an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Identify Entities (nouns: Student, Course, Professor, Department, etc.).\n2. Identify Attributes (properties of entities).\n3. Identify Relationships (verbs: \"enrolls in\", \"teaches\", \"belongs to\").\n4. Determine cardinalities and optionalities (1:1, 1:N, M:N; mandatory vs optional).\n\nThe ERD:\n\n- Focuses on the big picture, not on implementation details.\n- Is validated with stakeholders and revised until requirements are fully captured.\n\nEntities may support generalization hierarchies (e.g., Person → Student, Professor).\n\n==================================================\n9. LOGICAL DESIGN – ENTITIES AND ATTRIBUTES\n==================================================\n\nLogical design converts the conceptual model into a structure suitable for direct \nimplementation in a relational DBMS.\n\nTasks:\n\n- Define entities as tables.\n- Define attributes as columns (with names and data types).\n- Identify strong vs weak entities:\n  * Strong: exist independently (e.g., Product).\n  * Weak: existence depends on another entity (e.g., OrderDetail).\n\nGood naming conventions:\n\n- Singular, clear, unambiguous table and column names.\n- Avoid spaces; use underscores if necessary.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- Single-valued vs multi-valued vs derived.\n- Each attribute should help identify, describe, or classify an entity.\n- Multi-valued attributes often become separate entities (e.g., Skills for Employee).\n- Derived attributes are often computed (e.g., Age from BirthDate) rather than stored.\n\nData types:\n\n- Choose appropriate types (integer, decimal, char/varchar, date/time, etc.).\n- Consider range, precision, and storage.\n- Some DBMSs support user-defined types.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- CHECK constraints enforce allowed ranges or formats.\n- DEFAULT values can auto-fill common values.\n- Nullability: define whether a column can be left NULL.\n\n==================================================\n10. KEYS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN THE LOGICAL MODEL\n==================================================\n\nKeys:\n\n- Primary Key (PK):\n  * Uniquely identifies each row.\n  * Cannot be NULL.\n  * Should be stable (not change frequently).\n\n- Candidate Keys:\n  * Attributes that could serve as PKs.\n\n- Superkey:\n  * PK plus additional attributes (or any superset that still uniquely identifies rows).\n\n- Composite/Compound PKs:\n  * PK formed by multiple columns (e.g., (EmployeeID, ProjectID)).\n\nForeign Keys (FKs):\n\n- Implement relationships between tables.\n- Enforce referential integrity (FK values must exist in the referenced PK).\n\nRelationships:\n\n- One-to-one:\n  * Each row in A matches at most one row in B and vice versa.\n  * Sometimes implemented by sharing the same PK in two tables.\n\n- One-to-many:\n  * Most common relationship.\n  * PK on the “one” side; FK on the “many” side.\n\n- Many-to-many:\n  * Implemented via an intersection (join) table.\n  * The join table stores FKs to both sides and often uses (FK1, FK2) as a composite PK.\n\nOptionality:\n\n- Mandatory participation: FK cannot be NULL.\n- Optional participation: FK can be NULL.\n\nUnary (Recursive) relationships:\n\n- Relationship within the same table.\n  * Example: Employee manages Employees (manager_id references employee_id).\n  * May be 1:1 or 1:N.\n\n==================================================\n11. FOREIGN KEYS AS PRIMARY KEYS\n==================================================\n\nCases:\n\n1) FK as part of the PK (identifying relationship)\n   - Child’s identity is determined by the parent.\n   - Example: OrderDetail has PK (OrderID, ProductID).\n     Both columns are FKs and together form the PK.\n\n2) Child with independent PK (non-identifying relationship)\n   - Child has its own PK plus an FK to the parent.\n   - Example: Employee(EmpID PK, DeptID FK).\n     EmpID is enough to identify the employee.\n\n3) FK as the sole PK (strict 1:1)\n   - Example: Passport(PersonID PK, PersonID FK).\n     One person, one passport.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- Use FKs as PKs when the child cannot exist without the parent.\n- Use independent PKs when the child has its own life cycle.\n- Use FK-as-PK for true one-to-one relations.\n\n==================================================\n12. ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIPS – USE CASES\n==================================================\n\nWhen 1:1 relationships are useful:\n\n- Splitting large or sensitive data:\n  * Example: Users table vs UserDetails table.\n\n- Optional data:\n  * Example: Employee may or may not have a company car → separate CompanyCar table.\n\n- Security / Regulatory reasons:\n  * Example: separating personal identity data from confidential medical records.\n\n- Logical organization / performance:\n  * Frequently used attributes in one table, rarely used large attributes in another.\n\nExamples of 1:1 pairs:\n- Person – Passport\n- Employee – ParkingSpace\n- User – Profile\n- Country – CapitalCity\n- Student – Locker\n\n==================================================\n13. PHYSICAL DESIGN – OVERVIEW\n==================================================\n\nPhysical design is the final step where the logical model is implemented in a DBMS.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n- DBMS selection:\n  * Must support required constraints, data types, and business rules.\n  * Consider scalability, hardware requirements, cost, and tools.\n\n- Technical aspects:\n  * Storage requirements and access paths.\n  * Client-server or multi-tier architecture.\n  * Integration with development tools.\n\n- Economic factors:\n  * Licensing, hardware, migration costs, training, and maintenance.\n\nPhysical storage:\n\n- System tablespace:\n  * Internal DBMS structures and metadata.\n\n- Data tablespace:\n  * User databases and data files.\n\nEntities become tables, attributes become columns, and constraints are implemented \n(using PK, FK, CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, etc.). Indexes and views can be added to \nimprove performance or provide alternative interfaces.\n\n==================================================\n14. PHYSICAL DESIGN – ENTITIES TO TABLES\n==================================================\n\nTypes of tables:\n\n- Data tables (independent):\n  Store the main entities (e.g., Customer, Product).\n\n- Join/intersection tables:\n  Implement many-to-many relationships (e.g., EmployeeProject).\n\n- Lookup tables:\n  Hold static or reference data used for validation \n  (e.g., list of valid countries, statuses, types).\n\nTransforming relationships:\n\n- 1:1 → PK of parent appears as FK (and sometimes PK) in child.\n- 1:N → PK on the “one” side; FK in the “many” side.\n- M:N → Create an intersection table with FKs to both sides.\n\nTransforming attributes:\n\n- Choose concrete DBMS data types (VARCHAR, INT, DATE, DECIMAL, etc.).\n- Specify:\n  * Lengths or precision/scale.\n  * Default values.\n  * Nullability.\n  * Constraints and validation rules.\n\n==================================================\n15. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN – PRACTICE EXERCISES\n==================================================\n\nEXERCISE 01 – Online Learning Platform\n\nDesign an ER model for:\n- Students enroll in multiple courses.\n- Each course is taught by one professor (professor can teach many courses).\n- Students submit assignments for the courses they are enrolled in.\n- Professors grade assignments.\n\nSuggested entities and attributes:\n- Student(StudentID, Name, Surname, Email, Telephone, Address)\n- Professor(ProfessorID, Name, Email, Telephone)\n- Course(CourseID, CourseName, Description, Credits)\n- Assignment(AssignmentID, Title, Description, DueDate, CourseID)\n- Submission(SubmissionID, StudentID, AssignmentID, SubmissionDate, Grade)\n\nIdentify relationships and cardinalities:\n- Student–Course (M:N via Enrollment)\n- Course–Professor (N:1)\n- Course–Assignment (1:N)\n- Assignment–Submission (1:N)\n- Student–Submission (1:N)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nEXERCISE 02 – Sales Company\n--------------------------------------------------\nA company sells products to customers.

DATABASES AND DBMS – DEFINITIONS\n==================================================\n\nA database system (DBS) is a computerized record-keeping system whose purpose is to \nstore related data and make information available when required.\n\nA Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of software programs that allow the \ncreation, management, and controlled access to a database.\n\nExamples of popular DBMS: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB (NoSQL), etc.\n\n--------------------------------\n1.1 Objectives of Database Systems\n--------------------------------\n\nTypical objectives of a DBS include:\n\n- Security & Protection:\n  Prevent unauthorized access and protect data from concurrent interference.\n\n- Reliability:\n  Provide stable, predictable performance and safe storage.\n\n- Multi-user Support:\n  Allow multiple users and applications to work with the same data.\n\n- Flexibility:\n  Support different logical views and multiple ways of accessing data.\n\n- Ease of Data Access and Modification:\n  Provide high-level query languages (e.g., SQL).\n\n- Accuracy & Consistency:\n  Enforce integrity rules so data remains correct.\n\n- Clarity & Standardization:\n  Avoid ambiguity by using standardized formats and definitions.\n\n- Ability to Handle Unanticipated Requests:\n  Allow ad-hoc queries and reporting.\n\n- Protection of Investment:\n  Support backup and recovery.\n\n- Minimization of Data Proliferation:\n  Encourage reuse of existing data instead of creating redundant files.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n1.2 Data Independence\n--------------------------------\n\nData independence is the immunity of application programs to changes in data structure \nor access strategy.\n\n- Physical Data Independence:\n  Applications are independent of file organization, hardware, or storage medium.\n\n- Logical Data Independence:\n  Each user or application can have its own logical view of the data without \n  needing a global view.\n\nData independence is important because:\n- Different applications need different views of the same data.\n- Performance tuning and structural changes should not break existing programs.\n\n==================================================\n2. DBMS ARCHITECTURE (THREE LEVELS)\n==================================================\n\nA classic DBMS architecture includes three levels: external, conceptual, and internal.\n\n--------------------------------\n2.1 External Level (User Views)\n--------------------------------\n\n- Represents the individual views of different users or applications.\n- Defined by external schemas.\n- Each external schema shows only the portion of the database relevant to that user.\n- Applications access the database through these external schemas using host languages\n  (e.g., C, Java, Python) combined with the data sublanguage (SQL).\n\n--------------------------------\n2.2 Conceptual Level (Logical Schema)\n--------------------------------\n\n- An abstract representation of the entire database content.\n- Defined by the conceptual or logical schema.\n- Specifies:\n  * Entities and relationships\n  * Attributes and domains\n  * Security constraints, integrity checks, and business rules\n\n- Must be:\n  * Comprehensive (covers the whole database)\n  * Independent from physical storage details\n  * Compatible with data independence\n\n--------------------------------\n2.3 Internal Level (Storage View)\n--------------------------------\n\n- Low-level representation of the database.\n- Defined by the internal schema.\n- Deals with:\n  * Record formats and field representation\n  * Indexes\n  * File organization and storage sequence\n  * Access paths\n\nThis level has strong impact on performance (I/O, indexing, caching, etc.).\n\n==================================================\n3. DBMS COMPONENTS\n==================================================\n\nFunctional components of a DBMS include:\n\n- DBMS Engine:\n  Links subsystems to the physical device through the operating system. \n  Manages file access and data transfer.\n\n- Data Definition Subsystem:\n  Tools for defining and altering the schema (DDL).\n\n- User Interface Subsystem:\n  Allows users and applications to query the database using SQL or other interfaces.\n\n- Application Development Subsystem:\n  Tools for building forms, reports, menus, and application logic.\n\n- Data Administration Subsystem:\n  Utilities for backup, recovery, tuning, and storage management. Used by DBAs.\n\n- Data Dictionary / System Catalog:\n  Stores metadata about tables, columns, relationships, constraints, users, and privileges.\n\n- Data Communications Manager:\n  Manages communication between clients and the DBMS in client–server environments.\n\n- Utilities:\n  Programs for loading data, exporting/importing, gathering statistics, etc.\n\n==================================================\n4. FRONT-END VS BACK-END\n==================================================\n\n- Front-End:\n  End users, applications, and programming interfaces (IDEs such as Visual Studio, NetBeans, Qt).\n  Typically handles forms, reports, and business logic.\n\n- Back-End:\n  The DBMS and the database itself.\n  Responsible for storage, query processing, transaction management, concurrency, and recovery.\n\nFront-end and back-end may run on different machines connected via a network.\n\n==================================================\n5. DBMS VS FILE PROCESSING SYSTEMS\n==================================================\n\nTraditional file systems store data in separate files for each application.\n\nProblems with file processing:\n\n- Redundancy and Inconsistency:\n  Duplicate data across files leads to contradictory values.\n\n- Difficult Access:\n  New reports require new programs.\n\n- Data Isolation:\n  Data scattered in multiple files with different formats.\n\n- Lack of Integrity:\n  Hard to enforce rules (e.g., valid department numbers, account balances).\n\n- Atomicity Problems:\n  Multi-step operations (e.g., bank transfers) may fail in the middle.\n\n- Concurrency Problems:\n  Simultaneous updates may lead to lost updates or inconsistent data.\n\n- Security Problems:\n  Difficult to control user access to specific subsets of data.\n\nThe database approach, using a DBMS, provides integration and sharing of data, \nbetter integrity, and centralized control.\n\n==================================================\n6. DATABASE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (DDLC)\n==================================================\n\nPhases and typical deliverables:\n\n1) Database Investigation and Analysis\n   - Goal: understand business requirements.\n   - Deliverable: Initial Database Requirements.\n\n2) Database Modeling\n   - Build conceptual models (ERDs) and process models.\n   - Deliverable: Database Model.\n\n3) Database Designing\n   - Design the logical schema and constraints.\n   - Deliverable: Database Design Specification.\n\n4) Database Development\n   - Implement the logical design in a DBMS.\n   - Deliverable: Actual Database.\n\n5) Implementation\n   - Deploy database in production and integrate with applications.\n   - Deliverable: Database in Use.\n\n6) Management\n   - Monitor, tune, backup, and evolve the database.\n   - Deliverable: Enhanced Database and updated documentation.\n\nThe process is iterative: if requirements are incorrect or incomplete,\ndesign and analysis must be revisited.\n\n==================================================\n7. RELATIONAL MODEL FOUNDATIONS\n==================================================\n\nThe relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd (1970) and uses mathematical \nrelations (tables) to represent data.\n\nKey concepts:\n\n- Relation → Table.\n- Tuple → Row (record).\n- Attribute → Column (field).\n- Domain → Set of allowed values for an attribute.\n\nTables represent entity types; rows represent individual entities.\n\nRelationships between tables are represented using primary keys and foreign keys.\n\n--------------------------------\n7.1 Tables and Relationships\n--------------------------------\n\n- A table stores data in rows and columns.\n  Example: Books(BookID, Title, Author, Year).\n\n- A relationship connects tables via common attributes.\n  Common types:\n  * One-to-one (1:1)\n  * One-to-many (1:N)\n  * Many-to-many (M:N)\n\n- Referential Integrity:\n  Foreign keys in one table must match existing primary keys in another.\n  Prevents orphan records and ensures consistency.\n\n==================================================\n8. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ER MODEL\n==================================================\n\nConceptual design transforms user requirements into an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Identify Entities (nouns: Student, Course, Professor, Department, etc.).\n2. Identify Attributes (properties of entities).\n3. Identify Relationships (verbs: \"enrolls in\", \"teaches\", \"belongs to\").\n4. Determine cardinalities and optionalities (1:1, 1:N, M:N; mandatory vs optional).\n\nThe ERD:\n\n- Focuses on the big picture, not on implementation details.\n- Is validated with stakeholders and revised until requirements are fully captured.\n\nEntities may support generalization hierarchies (e.g., Person → Student, Professor).\n\n==================================================\n9. LOGICAL DESIGN – ENTITIES AND ATTRIBUTES\n==================================================\n\nLogical design converts the conceptual model into a structure suitable for direct \nimplementation in a relational DBMS.\n\nTasks:\n\n- Define entities as tables.\n- Define attributes as columns (with names and data types).\n- Identify strong vs weak entities:\n  * Strong: exist independently (e.g., Product).\n  * Weak: existence depends on another entity (e.g., OrderDetail).\n\nGood naming conventions:\n\n- Singular, clear, unambiguous table and column names.\n- Avoid spaces; use underscores if necessary.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- Single-valued vs multi-valued vs derived.\n- Each attribute should help identify, describe, or classify an entity.\n- Multi-valued attributes often become separate entities (e.g., Skills for Employee).\n- Derived attributes are often computed (e.g., Age from BirthDate) rather than stored.\n\nData types:\n\n- Choose appropriate types (integer, decimal, char/varchar, date/time, etc.).\n- Consider range, precision, and storage.\n- Some DBMSs support user-defined types.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- CHECK constraints enforce allowed ranges or formats.\n- DEFAULT values can auto-fill common values.\n- Nullability: define whether a column can be left NULL.\n\n==================================================\n10. KEYS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN THE LOGICAL MODEL\n==================================================\n\nKeys:\n\n- Primary Key (PK):\n  * Uniquely identifies each row.\n  * Cannot be NULL.\n  * Should be stable (not change frequently).\n\n- Candidate Keys:\n  * Attributes that could serve as PKs.\n\n- Superkey:\n  * PK plus additional attributes (or any superset that still uniquely identifies rows).\n\n- Composite/Compound PKs:\n  * PK formed by multiple columns (e.g., (EmployeeID, ProjectID)).\n\nForeign Keys (FKs):\n\n- Implement relationships between tables.\n- Enforce referential integrity (FK values must exist in the referenced PK).\n\nRelationships:\n\n- One-to-one:\n  * Each row in A matches at most one row in B and vice versa.\n  * Sometimes implemented by sharing the same PK in two tables.\n\n- One-to-many:\n  * Most common relationship.\n  * PK on the “one” side; FK on the “many” side.\n\n- Many-to-many:\n  * Implemented via an intersection (join) table.\n  * The join table stores FKs to both sides and often uses (FK1, FK2) as a composite PK.\n\nOptionality:\n\n- Mandatory participation: FK cannot be NULL.\n- Optional participation: FK can be NULL.\n\nUnary (Recursive) relationships:\n\n- Relationship within the same table.\n  * Example: Employee manages Employees (manager_id references employee_id).\n  * May be 1:1 or 1:N.\n\n==================================================\n11. FOREIGN KEYS AS PRIMARY KEYS\n==================================================\n\nCases:\n\n1) FK as part of the PK (identifying relationship)\n   - Child’s identity is determined by the parent.\n   - Example: OrderDetail has PK (OrderID, ProductID).\n     Both columns are FKs and together form the PK.\n\n2) Child with independent PK (non-identifying relationship)\n   - Child has its own PK plus an FK to the parent.\n   - Example: Employee(EmpID PK, DeptID FK).\n     EmpID is enough to identify the employee.\n\n3) FK as the sole PK (strict 1:1)\n   - Example: Passport(PersonID PK, PersonID FK).\n     One person, one passport.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- Use FKs as PKs when the child cannot exist without the parent.\n- Use independent PKs when the child has its own life cycle.\n- Use FK-as-PK for true one-to-one relations.\n\n==================================================\n12. ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIPS – USE CASES\n==================================================\n\nWhen 1:1 relationships are useful:\n\n- Splitting large or sensitive data:\n  * Example: Users table vs UserDetails table.\n\n- Optional data:\n  * Example: Employee may or may not have a company car → separate CompanyCar table.\n\n- Security / Regulatory reasons:\n  * Example: separating personal identity data from confidential medical records.\n\n- Logical organization / performance:\n  * Frequently used attributes in one table, rarely used large attributes in another.\n\nExamples of 1:1 pairs:\n- Person – Passport\n- Employee – ParkingSpace\n- User – Profile\n- Country – CapitalCity\n- Student – Locker\n\n==================================================\n13. PHYSICAL DESIGN – OVERVIEW\n==================================================\n\nPhysical design is the final step where the logical model is implemented in a DBMS.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n- DBMS selection:\n  * Must support required constraints, data types, and business rules.\n  * Consider scalability, hardware requirements, cost, and tools.\n\n- Technical aspects:\n  * Storage requirements and access paths.\n  * Client-server or multi-tier architecture.\n  * Integration with development tools.\n\n- Economic factors:\n  * Licensing, hardware, migration costs, training, and maintenance.\n\nPhysical storage:\n\n- System tablespace:\n  * Internal DBMS structures and metadata.\n\n- Data tablespace:\n  * User databases and data files.\n\nEntities become tables, attributes become columns, and constraints are implemented \n(using PK, FK, CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, etc.). Indexes and views can be added to \nimprove performance or provide alternative interfaces.\n\n==================================================\n14. PHYSICAL DESIGN – ENTITIES TO TABLES\n==================================================\n\nTypes of tables:\n\n- Data tables (independent):\n  Store the main entities (e.g., Customer, Product).\n\n- Join/intersection tables:\n  Implement many-to-many relationships (e.g., EmployeeProject).\n\n- Lookup tables:\n  Hold static or reference data used for validation \n  (e.g., list of valid countries, statuses, types).\n\nTransforming relationships:\n\n- 1:1 → PK of parent appears as FK (and sometimes PK) in child.\n- 1:N → PK on the “one” side; FK in the “many” side.\n- M:N → Create an intersection table with FKs to both sides.\n\nTransforming attributes:\n\n- Choose concrete DBMS data types (VARCHAR, INT, DATE, DECIMAL, etc.).\n- Specify:\n  * Lengths or precision/scale.\n  * Default values.\n  * Nullability.\n  * Constraints and validation rules.\n\n==================================================\n15.
