=== EVALUATION SCHEME ===

The course is evaluated in TWO TERMS. Each term represents 50% of the final grade.

8.1 First Term of the Period  (50% of final grade)

- Formative Evaluation (25%):
    * Quizzes:           7.5%
    * Project Advances: 10.0%
    * Assignments:       7.5%
    * Subtotal:         25%

- Midterm Evaluation (25%):
    * Midterm Theory Exam:   10%
    * Midterm Practice Exam: 15%
    * Subtotal:              25%

Total First Term = 50% of final course grade.


8.2 Second Term of the Period  (50% of final grade)

- Formative Evaluation (25%):
    * Quizzes:           7.5%
