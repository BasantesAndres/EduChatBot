DATABASE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

This text summarizes the requirements analysis process used when designing a database.

==================================================
1. PURPOSE OF REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
==================================================

Before designing a database, we must understand and document the business requirements.

Goals:
- Capture user, customer, and business needs.
- Identify the rules, data, and processes that define how the organization works.
- Produce a functional requirements specification that can be translated into 
  data models and system design.

The process is typically divided into three main stages:
1) Determining business requirements.
2) Analyzing requirements.
3) Evaluating requirements.

==================================================
2. DETERMINING BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Activities:

- Collect information from users about their tasks.
- Understand how data is interchanged and exchanged within the organization.
- Identify factors that affect business processes.

Typical techniques:
- Divide the organization into departments and functions.
- Interview users to learn:
  * What information they handle.
  * What processes they execute.
  * What business rules must be followed.

Because information and processes are interdependent, they must be studied together.
At this stage we:
- Identify entities (groups of related data).
- Identify relationships (connections between entities).
- Document business rules that may later enforce referential integrity or constraints.

==================================================
3. ANALYZING REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Once information is collected, it is analyzed to produce system requirements.

Key deliverables:

- Process models and Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):
  * Describe the flow of data and the operations performed by the system.

- Conceptual Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD):
  * High-level conceptual model of entities, relationships, and attributes.
  * Represents the data requirements of the business in a non-technical format.

Characteristics of the conceptual ERD:
- Focuses on structure and content of data, not on physical implementation.
- Serves as a basis to decompose into a more detailed logical data model.
- Used to verify that all business data needs have been captured.

The ERD and the process models must be consistent:
- They should describe the same business requirements from different angles
  (data vs processes).
- Inconsistencies between DFDs and ERD may indicate missing or incorrect requirements.

==================================================
4. EVALUATING REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

The final stage is requirements evaluation.

Objectives:
- Confirm that the gathered and analyzed requirements actually match
  the real needs of users and the organization.
- Check that all important information has been covered.
- Identify and resolve conflicts in the collected information.

If major conflicts or gaps are found:
- The requirements analysis cycle must be repeated.
- New interviews, revisions of process models, and updates to the ERD may be required.

Only when requirements are stable and consistent should database design proceed.

==================================================
5. SUMMARY
==================================================

Requirements analysis is a three-step, iterative process:

1) Determination:
   - Gather information about users, tasks, data, processes, and business rules.

2) Analysis:
   - Produce process models (DFDs) and a conceptual ERD that together describe
     how data is used and how processes operate.

3) Evaluation:
   - Verify coverage and correctness; resolve conflicts; refine models.

The results of this process become the foundation for conceptual, logical, and physical
database design. A good requirements analysis reduces redesign, improves data quality,
and ensures that the implemented database actually supports the organization’s goals.
